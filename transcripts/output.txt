First, we need to talk about data. So you see here, we have basically a CSV with a bunch of data, right? We have column one and column two. And if you're a bit perceptive, you notice that column three is a simple multiplication operation between column one and column two. Now, what a machine learning algorithm would do essentially is if you would tell it, hey, I have this data, I want to figure out what's the relation between column one and column two that can generate column three, a good machine learning algorithm would basically be able to figure out, oh, it's a multiplication. And you see here, we have a training dataset and a testing dataset. And that's because when we train a machine learning algorithm, when we try to make it figure out relations, we do so on a training dataset. And then we want to test that algorithm to make sure that it's learned something meaningful on some data that it's never seen before. And we call that a testing dataset where we don't actually give the solution.
